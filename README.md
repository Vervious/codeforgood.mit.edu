## Web Server Configuration

The web server should be configured to display `/404.html` for HTTP 404 errors.

## Development Workflow

The `master` branch contains GPG-signed tagged releases (tagged as `vX.X.X`).

The `develop` branch is where most of the development happens.

Release branches are named `release/X.X.X`, and hotfix branches are named
`hotfix/*`. Feature branches can have any name, as long as it does not conflict
with these naming patterns.
